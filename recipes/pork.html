    Got a crock pot? Buy one of those big ol things of meat that you never buy. Make this. Feel good.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1 3-1/2 to 4 pound pork shoulder, rinsed and cleaned</li>
    <li>1 16 oz jar mild salsa</li>
    <li>1 package corn or flour tortillas</li>
    <li>whatever you like to have on your tacos</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Place the first 7 ingredients in a bowl and mix.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place the pork shoulder in the Crock Pot (slow cooker) and rub all over with the seasoning mixture.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour the jar of salsa around the pork shoulder.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cook on low heat for 8-12 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove the pork to a plate and using 2 forks, shred the into bite size pieces (I like to remove the visible pieces of fat).
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour a scoop or two of the juices into the pork and stir to combine (If you want to remove the excess fat from the juice you will use, pour it into a cup and refrigerate it until the fat solidifies and can be easily scooped out. Only the juices will remain).
    </li>
    <li>
        Place the pork into the tortillas.
    </li>
    <li>
        Serve with desired accompaniments.
    </li>
