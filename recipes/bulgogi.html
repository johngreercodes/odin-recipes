<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    After my wife and I first got married, we bought a few weeks of Hello Fresh. 
    One of the meals that stuck with us was this: the beef bulgogi bowl!
</p>
<p>
    This is a nice and easy meal to make that incorporates some quick-pickled cucumbers.
    It's a good mix of heavy and light. Really everything you could want from a Bowl Of Stuffâ„¢!
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Ground beef</li>
    <li>Shredded carrots</li>
    <li>Cucumbers</li>
    <li>White vinegar</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Bulgogi sauce (just buy something pre-made)</li>
    <li>Green onion</li>
    <li>Pantry things (salt, pepper, oil, sesame seeds)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Peel the cucumbers into ribbons and put them in a bowl. Add vinegar and sugar to the bowl. These will pickle while you make the rest of the meal</li>
    <li>Start the rice cooking (I just do stovetop, ratio of 1 rice : 1.5 water, add some butter at the end, leave it in the pot til ready to eat)</li>
    <li>Saute the carrots with some salt and pepper. Just for a few minutes. Then throw them in the oven on "Keep warm" while you make the beef</li>
    <li>Saute the whites of the green onion</li>
    <li>Add ground beef and saute until browned</li>
    <li>Once fully cooked, drain any beef fat, add a splash of vinegar and shushel for about a minute</li>
    <li>Pour in bulgogi sauce and continue to simmer over low heat</li>
    <li>Add sesame seeds</li>
    <li>Plate it up! Rice, beef, carrots, pickles, and top with the greens of the green onion</li>
</ol>
